Things I'm longing for while using Ekad:

- Make it so nodes are selected when you first create them.
  I find myself making a node and wanting to type,
  but then I have to make another node instead.

- Make it so you can select a whole group of nodes at once
  so you can move them around and bring them someplace else.

- Make it so you can make a "group of nodes" and then connect a node to it.
  Sort of like a node which is a graph itself.

- Better text editing.
  - Be able to go back and forth with a cursor (incl. between lines).
  - Be be able to select stuff...
  - Pretty much just "copy the experience of a text box"
  - Automatically wrap text so I don't have to think about it
  - Make scaling look better
    - Don't track the bounding rectangle, intead use the bounding circle.
    - Track the point which is furthest from the center.
    - Use `radius / length of that vector (from center)` to calculate the scaling factor.

- Make it so you can delete edges.

Some earlier things I had written down:

- Define metadata around nodes to capture some basic information
  - Name, notes, scheduled time, etc.
- Add a UI around the graph viewer
  - Turn this into a Masonry widget
  - See if we can build an application around it in Masonry
  - Eventually: see if it can be integrated into Xilem?
- If we run into performance issues:
  - Make some way to like """cache""" scene elements,
    so we don't have to re-calculate a bunch of stuff around
    circles and lines and stuff like that.
